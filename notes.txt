Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite (done)
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre (done)
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio
. Clean up game loop (seperate event handling)

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

SUPER ULTRA MEGA CRITICAL:
 . Prepare for final release
   . fix requirements.txt
   . (minimal) code cleanup
   . remove unnecessary prints/draws
   . clean up images subfolder
   . finalise constants
   .


TASKS RN:
. cloud sprite (done)
. bird sprite (done)
. thrust, vel gui
. spawning for birds and clouds
  . fix current bug
    . birds and clouds interchanged!?!?
  . improve RNG
    . don't spawn close
  . make birds smaller
. game speed should stay same regardless
  of fps
. clean game loop
. rotation prop. to vel.
  . make nonlinear (sqrt..?)
. scale up game
. make play again background transparent, not black?
  . run render on all just before blitting play again,
    so you can see the collision that killed you
. start in fullscreen
. acceleration meeting
. tweak air density


ideas to fix rest of the things till code doesn't have errors
. thrust game_sprites line 235 add else:self.thrust.magnitude=0
. max vel game_sprites line 245 add if self.vel.magnitude>maxvel: self.vel.magnitude=maxvel
. increase gravity so that thrust can hardly make plane rise but also remove condition for lift and increase liftc
