Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite (done)
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre (done)
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio
. Clean up game loop (seperate event handling)

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

CRITICAL GOALS:

. cloud sprite
. bird sprite
. spawning for birds and clouds
. thrust in left limiting

ideas to fix rest of the things till code doesn't have errors
. thrust game_sprites line 235 add else:self.thrust.magnitude=0
. max vel game_sprites line 245 add if self.vel.magnitude>maxvel: self.vel.magnitude=maxvel
. increase gravity so that thrust can hardly make plane rise but also remove condition for lift and increase liftc
