Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite (done)
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre (done)
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio
. Clean up game loop (seperate event handling)

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

CRITICAL GOALS:

. cloud sprite
. bird sprite
. spawning for birds and clouds
. thrust in left limiting
. seperate terrain from background
