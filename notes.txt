Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

CRITICAL GOALS:

(done). collisions
(done). terrain (drawing)
. plane sprite (drawing)
  . rotate around  centre
. background resolution
. performance
  . surf, screen etc.
. bird sprite
. air density
. figure out how resizing works
. random sprite generation
. clean up game loop (seperate event handling)
