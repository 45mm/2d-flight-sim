Everything to work on (in near future)

. Resolution
. Image masks
. Finalise physics (max, min values for thrust, gravity value,..?)
. Scrolling
  .Vertical scrolling
  .Make map bigger (so only a portion is displayed at a time)
. Clouds, birds (sprites cloud engine stalling, bird collisions)
. Change the map
. Plane sprite
. Window resizing
