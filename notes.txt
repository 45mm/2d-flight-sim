Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite (done)
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre (done)
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

CRITICAL GOALS:

. rotate around  centre
. plane sprite adding to init.py
. clean up game loop (seperate event handling)
. spawn frequency for birds and clouds
