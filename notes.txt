Everything to work on (in near future)

. Image masks
. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (sprites cloud engine stalling, bird collisions)
. Change the map
. Plane sprite
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

CRITICAL GOALS:

(done). collisions
(done). terrain (drawing)
. plane sprite (drawing)
. air density
. clouds sprite generation
. birds debug
. random sprite generation
. blue background
