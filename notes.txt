Everything to work on (in near future)

. Image masks
. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (sprites cloud engine stalling, bird collisions)
. Change the map
. Plane sprite
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio

Work distribution:

Yash - imagemasks
Granth - resizing
AK - scrolling
Mathew -terrain

CRITICAL GOALS:

. collisions
. terrain (drawing)
. plane sprite (drawing)
. air density
. clouds: cloud spawns on player
. birds
. optimise framerates
