Everything to work on (in near future)

. Finalise physics
  . finalise values for lift, drag, thrust, etc.
  . torque
  . air density
. Clouds, birds (RNG)
. Plane sprite (done)
  . Sprite rotate around end, not centre (done)
. Window resizing
  . decide on what happens (scaling, or you can see more)
  . maintain aspect ratio
. Clean up game loop (seperate event handling)

Work distribution:

Yash - air density
Granth - clouds
AK - birds
Mathew - terrain, plane sprite

SUPER ULTRA MEGA CRITICAL:
 . Prepare for final release
   . (done) fix requirements.txt
   . (done) (minimal) code cleanup
   . (done) (later) remove unnecessary prints/draws
   . clean up images subfolder
   . finalise constants
   . 

PRIORITY SECONDARY TASKS:
. gravity #yg: 0.1
. spawning for birds and clouds -Granth
. scale up game #yg: ?
. make birds smaller
. rotation prop. to vel.
  . make nonlinear (sqrt..?) - Granth
. thrust, vel gui (numbers on screen) #yg: done
. thrust, vel meter #check

. tweak air density #change lift works
. (done) window icon #WIP
. (done) window header #noframe or frame?
. toggle fullscreen - Yash
. fps
. player spawn position

TASKS RN:
. thrust, vel gui
. spawning for birds and clouds
  . improve RNG
    . don't spawn close
    . delete when offscreen N
  . make birds smaller
. game speed should stay same regardless
  of fps
. (~meh) clean game loop
. rotation prop. to vel.
  . make nonlinear (sqrt..?)
. (done) make play again background transparent, not black?
  . run render on all just before blitting play again,
    so you can see the collision that killed you
  . start in fullscreen
. acceleration meeting
. tweak air density
. gravity 0.03?
. scale up game
. player spawn position N


ideas to fix rest of the things till code doesn't have errors
. thrust game_sprites line 235 add else:self.thrust.magnitude=0
. max vel game_sprites line 245 add if self.vel.magnitude>maxvel: self.vel.magnitude=maxvel
. increase gravity so that thrust can hardly make plane rise but also remove condition for lift and increase liftc
